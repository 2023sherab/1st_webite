    <h5>2019-2022</h5>
    <p>After completing high school I joined college of language aand cultural studies in Trongsa, Bhutan</p>
    <h3>Experiences</h3>
    <p>Since I have just completed my college recently I haven't joined any of the jobs. Before of joing into services i thought of skilling up myself in various technological courses provided across the countrries so that once i join services it will come handy. <br><br> In order to get in touch with recent technological advancement firstly, i did one month in ICT foundation and digital literacy from DSP training in Yonphula. Second, I also did basic coding in same centre and currently am pursuing course in funtadamentals of web development and UX design at DSP training centre Phaduna.</p>
